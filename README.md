## Endpoint Security Investigation

### Host Information
- **Hostname:** AdamPRD  
- **OS:** Windows 10 (64-bit)  
- **IP Address:** 10.15.15.18  
- **Last Login:** Dec 01, 2020, 03:21 PM  
- **Client/Server Role:** Client

From the Endpoint Security dashboard, we gathered the following findings:
- No agents were installed on the machine, limiting the ability to quarantine the ransomware automatically.
- Review of the **process history**, **network connections**, **CMD history**, and **browser history** revealed no unusual activity directly related to the Maze ransomware before detection.

## Conclusion and Mitigation

The incident was confirmed as a **true positive** involving Maze ransomware. The malicious file `Invoice.exe` was allowed to run on the host `AdamPRD`, which then attempted to communicate with a Command and Control server. Although no agents were installed on the system, containment measures were initiated to quarantine the host.

Further actions recommended:
- Full inspection of systems within the same local network segment.
- Deploy endpoint protection agents to enhance real-time detection and response.
